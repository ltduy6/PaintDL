# PaintDL

## Description
This is my solo project for the Programming Systems course in my university. It aims to empower individuals to unleash their creativity, explore their imagination, and craft visually stunning artworks. This application is inspired by Microsoft Paint app.

## Requirements
This works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. Please ensure that you have downloaded ```cmake``` and a C++ compiler.

## Building
To build the project, follow the commands: 
```
cmake -S. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```
This will create a directory named ```build``` and create all artifacts here. The main executable file can be found in the ```build/subprojects/Build/wx_cmake_template_core``` folder.

## Usage
I have a demonstration video in [PaintDL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARDCHONIg_4).
